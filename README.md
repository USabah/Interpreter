# Interpreter
The following is an fsharp program which (given a module which is part of a package written by a professor of mine) will serve as the interpreter for the mongoose programming lanuage. The purpose of me uploading this is to demonstrate the pattern matching, which has a major advantage over OOP and dynamic dispatch as pattern matching can read multiple data structures at once. This program is not intended to run on its own and I won't be including the CSC7B package as I did not create this package.
